# Matrix Solver

Personal Project intended to row reduce a matrix given by the user in the terminal, and return it.

### How to use
Run Matrix.py, and enter the number of rows, then the number of columns for the desired matrix.
From there, enter each element of each row (one at a time), and the solver will print out the row reduced form of the matrix.

### Notes
This project adapts code from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/converting-matrix-into-row-echelon-form-in-python/  
- Changes made:
-   allowing the program to put the given matrix in RREF form, rather than REF
-   works from console-based user input
